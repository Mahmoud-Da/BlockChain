*** 34. What is Bitcoin? ***

# Blockchain Course – Module Two: Introduction to Bitcoin

## Purpose of this Tutorial

* Begin Module Two focused on **cryptocurrencies**.
* Establish a **clear understanding** of:

  * Blockchain
  * Bitcoin
  * Protocols
  * Coins
  * Tokens
* Address confusion and misleading terminology.
* Build a **solid foundation** for the rest of the module and course.

---

## The Three Layers of Crypto

### 1. Technology Layer

* **Blockchain** is the base technology.
* Already discussed in Module One.

### 2. Protocol Layer

* Protocol = **set of rules** guiding communication across a network.
* Examples: TCP/IP, HTTP, Internet Protocol.
* **Bitcoin is a protocol**, not just a coin.

  * Dictates consensus rules.
  * Defines use of public/private keys and signatures.
  * Determines update procedures.
* Other crypto protocols: **Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero, Zcash, Bitcoin Cash, Neo, Waves**.
* Each protocol has **one native coin**:

  * Bitcoin → BTC
  * Ethereum → Ether
  * Ripple → XRP
  * Litecoin → LTC, etc.
* Coins are **innate assets** used for:

  * Mining rewards.
  * Peer-to-peer transactions.

### 3. Token Layer

* Tokens are built **on top of protocols** via smart contracts.
* ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) = actually **token offerings**, not coin offerings.
* Tokens depend on the underlying protocol:

  * Ethereum → most tokens (hundreds).
  * Neo → many tokens.
  * Waves → a few tokens.
  * Bitcoin & Ripple → no tokens (no smart contracts).

---

## Key Example: CoinMarketCap.com

* Shows **hundreds of cryptocurrencies**.
* Separates between **coins** and **tokens**.
* Clarifies:

  * Investing in a coin = investing in the protocol itself.
  * Investing in a token = investing in the project/idea built on top.

---

## What is Bitcoin?

### Origins

* Invented in **2008** by **Satoshi Nakamoto** (identity unknown).
* Described in the white paper: *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*.
* Implemented in **2009**, continuously developed since.

### Purpose

* Take blockchain from **theory to practice**.
* Enable **trustless peer-to-peer transactions** without intermediaries (e.g., banks).
* Protocol enables **exchange of value** through coins.
* Bitcoin → first and most established protocol in this space.

### Ecosystem Participants

1. **Nodes** – Devices that participate in the network (not mining).
2. **Miners** – Validate and add transactions/blocks.
3. **Large Miners** – Industrial-scale mining operations.
4. **Mining Pools** – Groups of miners combining resources.

---

## Core Takeaways

* **Bitcoin is a protocol** (rules of operation), not just a coin.
* Protocols each have one native coin; coins enable secure value transfer.
* Tokens are **built on protocols** via smart contracts (different layer).
* The banking sector is bypassed: users transact directly via technology.
* Bitcoin is chosen as the **primary case study** because it is:

  * The most famous, longest-running, and widely adopted cryptocurrency.

## Suggested Reading

* **Satoshi Nakamoto (2008)** – *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*

  * Not overly technical; accessible introduction to the original vision.

*** 35. Bitcoin's Monetary Policy ***

# Blockchain Course – Bitcoin’s Monetary Policy

---

## what is Monetary Policy?

Monetary policy is basically how a country manages its money supply and interest rates to keep the economy stable.

Governments (through central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve or the Bank of Japan) use monetary policy to:

* Control inflation (make sure prices don’t rise too fast).
* Encourage economic growth (by making borrowing easier or harder).
* Keep employment stable.

They do this mainly by:

1. **Changing interest rates** – lowering them to encourage borrowing and spending, or raising them to slow down inflation.
2. **Controlling money supply** – adding more money into the economy or restricting it.

In short: **Monetary policy is how central banks control money and credit to keep the economy healthy.**


## Introduction

* Just like central banks have **monetary policies**, Bitcoin has its own.
* Bitcoin’s monetary policy consists of two key components:

  1. **Halving**
  2. **Block Frequency**

---

## 1. The Halving Principle

### Definition

* The **block reward** (Bitcoins released per mined block) is halved every **210,000 blocks** (\~4 years).
* Fully pre-programmed in the **Bitcoin algorithm** (not decided by people).

### Historical Halvings

* 2009: 50 BTC per block.
* 2012: 25 BTC per block.
* 2016: 12.5 BTC per block.
* 2020: 6.25 BTC per block.
* 2024: 3.125 BTC per block.
* Continues halving until approximately **2140**.

### Supply Limit

* Because of Bitcoin’s divisibility limits, the **final reward** will be mined in **2140**.
* Total maximum supply: **21 million Bitcoins**.

### Effect on Supply & Inflation

* Block reward → decreases exponentially, approaching zero.
* Supply curve → asymptotic, converging to 21 million BTC.
* Inflation (new BTC released / existing BTC supply):

  * Decreases over time.
  * Leads to **deflationary nature** of Bitcoin (opposite of fiat currencies).

### Miner Incentives & Fees

* As block rewards decrease, **transaction fees** are expected to:

  * Increase with Bitcoin adoption.
  * Compensate miners for reduced rewards.
* Sustainability depends on **network demand** and **market adoption**.

---

## 2. Block Frequency

### Definition

* The time interval between the creation of two consecutive blocks.

### Examples by Cryptocurrency

* **Bitcoin** → \~10 minutes.
* **Ethereum** → \~15 seconds.
* **Ripple** → \~3.5 seconds.
* **Litecoin** → \~2.5 minutes.

### Mechanism

* Actual block times vary (statistical process).
* Controlled to average \~10 minutes via **difficulty adjustment** (explained later in course).

### Live Example (Blockchain.com)

* Latest block times fluctuate (e.g., 3 min, 11 min, 17 min).
* Averaged over time → \~10 minutes.
* Useful resource: **blockchain.com / blockchain.info** for live data and statistics.

---

## Key Insights

* **Halving** controls Bitcoin’s supply and ensures scarcity.
* Total supply capped at **21 million BTC**.
* Bitcoin’s monetary system is **algorithm-driven** (not controlled by central authority).
* Bitcoin is **deflationary**, contrasting fiat currencies subject to inflation.
* Miner rewards shift gradually from block rewards → transaction fees.
* **Block frequency** ensures predictable block creation across time.

---

## Suggested Reading

* **Satoshi Nakamoto (2008)** – *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System* (bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).
* **Mark Jeftovic** – *This Time is Different Part 2: What Bitcoin Really Is*.

  * Discusses Bitcoin vs. fiat monetary policy.
  * Explores inflation, deflation, and central banking contrasts.
