*** 34. What is Bitcoin? ***

# Blockchain Course – Module Two: Introduction to Bitcoin

## Purpose of this Tutorial

* Begin Module Two focused on **cryptocurrencies**.
* Establish a **clear understanding** of:

  * Blockchain
  * Bitcoin
  * Protocols
  * Coins
  * Tokens
* Address confusion and misleading terminology.
* Build a **solid foundation** for the rest of the module and course.

---

## The Three Layers of Crypto

### 1. Technology Layer

* **Blockchain** is the base technology.
* Already discussed in Module One.

### 2. Protocol Layer

* Protocol = **set of rules** guiding communication across a network.
* Examples: TCP/IP, HTTP, Internet Protocol.
* **Bitcoin is a protocol**, not just a coin.

  * Dictates consensus rules.
  * Defines use of public/private keys and signatures.
  * Determines update procedures.
* Other crypto protocols: **Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero, Zcash, Bitcoin Cash, Neo, Waves**.
* Each protocol has **one native coin**:

  * Bitcoin → BTC
  * Ethereum → Ether
  * Ripple → XRP
  * Litecoin → LTC, etc.
* Coins are **innate assets** used for:

  * Mining rewards.
  * Peer-to-peer transactions.

### 3. Token Layer

* Tokens are built **on top of protocols** via smart contracts.
* ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) = actually **token offerings**, not coin offerings.
* Tokens depend on the underlying protocol:

  * Ethereum → most tokens (hundreds).
  * Neo → many tokens.
  * Waves → a few tokens.
  * Bitcoin & Ripple → no tokens (no smart contracts).

---

## Key Example: CoinMarketCap.com

* Shows **hundreds of cryptocurrencies**.
* Separates between **coins** and **tokens**.
* Clarifies:

  * Investing in a coin = investing in the protocol itself.
  * Investing in a token = investing in the project/idea built on top.

---

## What is Bitcoin?

### Origins

* Invented in **2008** by **Satoshi Nakamoto** (identity unknown).
* Described in the white paper: *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*.
* Implemented in **2009**, continuously developed since.

### Purpose

* Take blockchain from **theory to practice**.
* Enable **trustless peer-to-peer transactions** without intermediaries (e.g., banks).
* Protocol enables **exchange of value** through coins.
* Bitcoin → first and most established protocol in this space.

### Ecosystem Participants

1. **Nodes** – Devices that participate in the network (not mining).
2. **Miners** – Validate and add transactions/blocks.
3. **Large Miners** – Industrial-scale mining operations.
4. **Mining Pools** – Groups of miners combining resources.

---

## Core Takeaways

* **Bitcoin is a protocol** (rules of operation), not just a coin.
* Protocols each have one native coin; coins enable secure value transfer.
* Tokens are **built on protocols** via smart contracts (different layer).
* The banking sector is bypassed: users transact directly via technology.
* Bitcoin is chosen as the **primary case study** because it is:

  * The most famous, longest-running, and widely adopted cryptocurrency.

*** 35. Bitcoin's Monetary Policy ***

# Blockchain Course – Bitcoin’s Monetary Policy

---

## what is Monetary Policy?

Monetary policy is basically how a country manages its money supply and interest rates to keep the economy stable.

Governments (through central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve or the Bank of Japan) use monetary policy to:

* Control inflation (make sure prices don’t rise too fast).
* Encourage economic growth (by making borrowing easier or harder).
* Keep employment stable.

They do this mainly by:

1. **Changing interest rates** – lowering them to encourage borrowing and spending, or raising them to slow down inflation.
2. **Controlling money supply** – adding more money into the economy or restricting it.

In short: **Monetary policy is how central banks control money and credit to keep the economy healthy.**


## Introduction

* Just like central banks have **monetary policies**, Bitcoin has its own.
* Bitcoin’s monetary policy consists of two key components:

  1. **Halving**
  2. **Block Frequency**

---

## 1. The Halving Principle

### Definition

* The **block reward** (Bitcoins released per mined block) is halved every **210,000 blocks** (\~4 years).
* Fully pre-programmed in the **Bitcoin algorithm** (not decided by people).

### Historical Halvings

* 2009: 50 BTC per block.
* 2012: 25 BTC per block.
* 2016: 12.5 BTC per block.
* 2020: 6.25 BTC per block.
* 2024: 3.125 BTC per block.
* Continues halving until approximately **2140**.

### Supply Limit

* Because of Bitcoin’s divisibility limits, the **final reward** will be mined in **2140**.
* Total maximum supply: **21 million Bitcoins**.

### Effect on Supply & Inflation

* Block reward → decreases exponentially, approaching zero.
* Supply curve → asymptotic, converging to 21 million BTC.
* Inflation (new BTC released / existing BTC supply):

  * Decreases over time.
  * Leads to **deflationary nature** of Bitcoin (opposite of fiat currencies).

### Miner Incentives & Fees

* As block rewards decrease, **transaction fees** are expected to:

  * Increase with Bitcoin adoption.
  * Compensate miners for reduced rewards.
* Sustainability depends on **network demand** and **market adoption**.

---

## 2. Block Frequency

### Definition

* The time interval between the creation of two consecutive blocks.

### Examples by Cryptocurrency

* **Bitcoin** → \~10 minutes.
* **Ethereum** → \~15 seconds.
* **Ripple** → \~3.5 seconds.
* **Litecoin** → \~2.5 minutes.

### Mechanism

* Actual block times vary (statistical process).
* Controlled to average \~10 minutes via **difficulty adjustment** (explained later in course).

### What if there are no miners?

* **No new blocks will be created.** Since miners are the ones solving cryptographic puzzles to add blocks, the blockchain would simply stop.
* **No transactions get confirmed.** Users could still broadcast transactions, but they would remain pending in the mempool forever.
* **The system freezes.** Without miners, Bitcoin’s network cannot move forward, because mining is essential for both transaction validation and block creation.

### Why miners matter?

* Miners keep the blockchain secure by validating transactions.
* They add blocks, which also releases new bitcoins (block rewards + fees).
* If miners disappear, the incentive to secure the network is gone, and the blockchain halts.

---

### Case 1: No Miners

* **No new blocks are created** → the blockchain halts.
* **Transactions remain unconfirmed** in the mempool.
* **No security** → the network is unusable because no one is validating or adding blocks.

---

### Case 2: Very Few Miners

* **Blocks become very slow.** If only a few miners are left, finding the cryptographic puzzle takes much longer than 10 minutes.
* **Difficulty Adjustment:**

  * Bitcoin automatically adjusts mining difficulty every **2016 blocks (\~2 weeks)**.
  * If blocks are too slow, the difficulty lowers, making it easier for the small number of miners to find blocks.
  * Over time, this brings the block frequency back closer to the 10-minute target.
* **Security Risk:**

  * With very few miners, the network is easier to attack (e.g., 51% attack).
  * The system still works, but it’s less secure and more centralized.

---

In short:

* **No miners = system stops.**
* **Few miners = system slows but difficulty readjusts, eventually stabilizing, though with weaker security.**

### Live Example (Blockchain.com)

* Latest block times fluctuate (e.g., 3 min, 11 min, 17 min).
* Averaged over time → \~10 minutes.
* Useful resource: **blockchain.com / blockchain.info** for live data and statistics.

---

## Key Insights

* **Halving** controls Bitcoin’s supply and ensures scarcity.
* Total supply capped at **21 million BTC**.
* Bitcoin’s monetary system is **algorithm-driven** (not controlled by central authority).
* Bitcoin is **deflationary**, contrasting fiat currencies subject to inflation.
* Miner rewards shift gradually from block rewards → transaction fees.
* **Block frequency** ensures predictable block creation across time.

*** 36. Understanding Mining Difficulty ***

---

# Mining Difficulty

## 1. Introduction

* Mining difficulty was mentioned in Module 1 when discussing the mining target.
* This lecture provides a deeper understanding:

  1. What is the current target and how does it feel for a miner?
  2. How is mining difficulty calculated and adjusted?

---

## 2. Understanding the Current Target

### Leading Zeros and Pool Size

* Target is often represented by the number of leading zeros in the hash.
* Misleading diagram example:

  * 4 leading zeros looked like it reduced pool size to a quarter.
  * In reality, **one leading zero reduces the pool size by 16×** in hexadecimal.
  * 2 leading zeros reduce it by 16 × 16 = 1/256.
  * 3 leading zeros reduce it by 1/4096, and so on.

### Decimal Analogy

* With 5-digit numbers:

  * Full range: 0–99,999 → 100,000 options.
  * With 1 leading zero required: 0–9,999 → 10,000 options.
  * Reduced by 10×.
* In hexadecimal, each leading zero reduces by 16×.

### Current Example

* At recording: **18 leading zeros** required.
* Total possible hashes: 16^64 ≈ 10^77.
* With 18 zeros: 16^(64–18) ≈ 10^55 possible valid hashes.
* Probability: 10^55 / 10^77 = \~10^-22 (extremely small).
* Intuition: Less likely than winning most lotteries.
* Explains why mining requires massive computational power.

---

## 3. Mining Difficulty Definition

### Formula

* **Difficulty = Max Target ÷ Current Target**.

### Adjustment Period

* Adjusted every **2016 blocks** (≈ 2 weeks).
* Designed so each block takes \~10 minutes.
* If blocks are mined faster or slower, difficulty adjusts up or down.

### Max Target

* Defined at Bitcoin’s inception.
* Started with about **8 leading zeros**.
* Not the maximum possible hex number (all Fs).
* If it had started at the absolute maximum, mining would have been trivial and too many Bitcoins would have been mined before difficulty adjustment.

---

## 4. Intuitive Meaning of Difficulty

* Measures **how much harder it is to mine now compared to the beginning**.
* Example: Current difficulty ≈ 3 trillion.

  * Means it is \~3 trillion times harder to mine a Bitcoin than at the start.

---

## 5. Practical Observations

* Current target can be observed by looking at block hashes (leading zeros).
* Probability is consistent across nodes because difficulty adjustment is built into the Bitcoin protocol.
* Adjustment happens automatically without central authority.
* Each node independently recalculates based on the last 2016 blocks.

---

## 6. Difficulty Chart

* Chart appears stepped because adjustments occur every two weeks.
* At launch: difficulty = 1.
* As more miners joined and hash power increased, difficulty rose dramatically to maintain 10-minute block intervals.

---

## 7. Broader Perspective

* Centralized banking relies on complex macroeconomic tools like interest rates.
* Bitcoin’s decentralized system uses a **simple algorithm (adjusting required leading zeros)**.
* Despite global participation and powerful mining hardware (CPUs, GPUs, ASICs), the system remains stable.
* Demonstrates how a decentralized system can be as effective—or more efficient—than centralized monetary policy.

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

* Mining difficulty ensures blocks are consistently mined every 10 minutes.
* Probability of finding a valid nonce is extraordinarily small.
* Difficulty adjusts automatically every two weeks to balance network power.
* Difficulty today is trillions of times higher than at Bitcoin’s start.
* The system’s elegance lies in its simplicity and decentralization.
