# Blockchain Course – Module Two: Plan of Attack

## Overview

* Module Two is a **large and foundational section**.
* Goal: Understand **Bitcoin** in depth while building broader knowledge of blockchain and cryptocurrency.
* Total: **12 tutorials + 1 optional extra tutorial**.

---

## Tutorial Breakdown

### 1. What is Bitcoin?

* Bird’s-eye view of the crypto space.
* Three layers:

  * Technology layer
  * Protocol layer
  * Token layer
* Understand protocols, why Bitcoin is a protocol.
* Difference between **coins vs tokens**.

### 2. Bitcoin’s Monetary Policy

* Comparison with central banks.
* Governed entirely by **software**.
* Foundation for understanding how Bitcoin operates independently.

### 3. Mining Difficulty

* Builds on Module One concepts.
* Links with Bitcoin’s monetary policy.
* Explains how software enforces scarcity and policy.
* **Challenging but critical tutorial.**

### 4. Virtual Tour of Bitcoin Mines

* Look inside industrial-level Bitcoin mining facilities.
* See the **physical reality** behind mining.

### 5. Mining Pools

* How miners collaborate.
* Reasons for forming pools.

### 6. The Nonce Range

* Extends understanding of the Nonce.
* Covers challenges and technical details.
* Importance: Often overlooked in blockchain discussions.

### 7. How Miners Pick Transactions (Two-Part Tutorial)

1. **Process of selecting transactions** for inclusion in blocks.
2. **Live examples** of blockchain transactions and statistics.

### 8. Hardware for Mining

* Comparison of mining hardware:

  * CPUs
  * GPUs
  * ASICs
* Explanation of differences and roles in mining Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others.

### 9. Mempools

* Staging area for pending transactions.
* How mempools propagate information across the network.

### 10. Orphaned Blocks

* What happens when chains compete.
* Impact on transactions within orphaned blocks.
* Real-world examples of orphaned blocks.

### 11. The 51% Attack

* Clear explanation of what it **is and is not**.
* Why it is dangerous.
* Removes misconceptions surrounding the concept.

### 12. Extra: Bits to Target (Optional)

* Mathematical/technical tutorial.
* Useful for **developers**.
* Not mandatory but good for deeper understanding.

---

## Key Takeaways

* Module Two provides a **comprehensive foundation** in Bitcoin and blockchain mechanics.
* Covers both **theoretical concepts** (monetary policy, 51% attack) and **practical details** (mining hardware, mempools, transaction selection).
* After completing, learners will be **much more proficient** in blockchain and cryptocurrency concepts.

# Blockchain Course – Module Two: Introduction to Bitcoin

## Purpose of this Tutorial

* Begin Module Two focused on **cryptocurrencies**.
* Establish a **clear understanding** of:

  * Blockchain
  * Bitcoin
  * Protocols
  * Coins
  * Tokens
* Address confusion and misleading terminology.
* Build a **solid foundation** for the rest of the module and course.

## The Three Layers of Crypto

### 1. Technology Layer

* **Blockchain** is the base technology.
* Already discussed in Module One.

### 2. Protocol Layer

* Protocol = **set of rules** guiding communication across a network.
* Examples: TCP/IP, HTTP, Internet Protocol.
* **Bitcoin is a protocol**, not just a coin.

  * Dictates consensus rules.
  * Defines use of public/private keys and signatures.
  * Determines update procedures.
* Other crypto protocols: **Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero, Zcash, Bitcoin Cash, Neo, Waves**.
* Each protocol has **one native coin**:

  * Bitcoin → BTC
  * Ethereum → Ether
  * Ripple → XRP
  * Litecoin → LTC, etc.
* Coins are **innate assets** used for:

  * Mining rewards.
  * Peer-to-peer transactions.

### 3. Token Layer

* Tokens are built **on top of protocols** via smart contracts.
* ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) = actually **token offerings**, not coin offerings.
* Tokens depend on the underlying protocol:

  * Ethereum → most tokens (hundreds).
  * Neo → many tokens.
  * Waves → a few tokens.
  * Bitcoin & Ripple → no tokens (no smart contracts).

---

## Key Example: CoinMarketCap.com

* Shows **hundreds of cryptocurrencies**.
* Separates between **coins** and **tokens**.
* Clarifies:

  * Investing in a coin = investing in the protocol itself.
  * Investing in a token = investing in the project/idea built on top.

## What is Bitcoin?

### Origins

* Invented in **2008** by **Satoshi Nakamoto** (identity unknown).
* Described in the white paper: *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*.
* Implemented in **2009**, continuously developed since.

### Purpose

* Take blockchain from **theory to practice**.
* Enable **trustless peer-to-peer transactions** without intermediaries (e.g., banks).
* Protocol enables **exchange of value** through coins.
* Bitcoin → first and most established protocol in this space.

### Ecosystem Participants

1. **Nodes** – Devices that participate in the network (not mining).
2. **Miners** – Validate and add transactions/blocks.
3. **Large Miners** – Industrial-scale mining operations.
4. **Mining Pools** – Groups of miners combining resources.

---

## Core Takeaways

* **Bitcoin is a protocol** (rules of operation), not just a coin.
* Protocols each have one native coin; coins enable secure value transfer.
* Tokens are **built on protocols** via smart contracts (different layer).
* The banking sector is bypassed: users transact directly via technology.
* Bitcoin is chosen as the **primary case study** because it is:

  * The most famous, longest-running, and widely adopted cryptocurrency.

  * Not overly technical; accessible introduction to the original vision.
