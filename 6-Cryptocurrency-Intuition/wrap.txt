*** 34. What is Bitcoin? ***

# Blockchain Course – Module Two: Introduction to Bitcoin

## Purpose of this Tutorial

* Begin Module Two focused on **cryptocurrencies**.
* Establish a **clear understanding** of:

  * Blockchain
  * Bitcoin
  * Protocols
  * Coins
  * Tokens
* Address confusion and misleading terminology.
* Build a **solid foundation** for the rest of the module and course.

---

## The Three Layers of Crypto

### 1. Technology Layer

* **Blockchain** is the base technology.
* Already discussed in Module One.

### 2. Protocol Layer

* Protocol = **set of rules** guiding communication across a network.
* Examples: TCP/IP, HTTP, Internet Protocol.
* **Bitcoin is a protocol**, not just a coin.

  * Dictates consensus rules.
  * Defines use of public/private keys and signatures.
  * Determines update procedures.
* Other crypto protocols: **Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero, Zcash, Bitcoin Cash, Neo, Waves**.
* Each protocol has **one native coin**:

  * Bitcoin → BTC
  * Ethereum → Ether
  * Ripple → XRP
  * Litecoin → LTC, etc.
* Coins are **innate assets** used for:

  * Mining rewards.
  * Peer-to-peer transactions.

### 3. Token Layer

* Tokens are built **on top of protocols** via smart contracts.
* ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) = actually **token offerings**, not coin offerings.
* Tokens depend on the underlying protocol:

  * Ethereum → most tokens (hundreds).
  * Neo → many tokens.
  * Waves → a few tokens.
  * Bitcoin & Ripple → no tokens (no smart contracts).

---

## Key Example: CoinMarketCap.com

* Shows **hundreds of cryptocurrencies**.
* Separates between **coins** and **tokens**.
* Clarifies:

  * Investing in a coin = investing in the protocol itself.
  * Investing in a token = investing in the project/idea built on top.

---

## What is Bitcoin?

### Origins

* Invented in **2008** by **Satoshi Nakamoto** (identity unknown).
* Described in the white paper: *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*.
* Implemented in **2009**, continuously developed since.

### Purpose

* Take blockchain from **theory to practice**.
* Enable **trustless peer-to-peer transactions** without intermediaries (e.g., banks).
* Protocol enables **exchange of value** through coins.
* Bitcoin → first and most established protocol in this space.

### Ecosystem Participants

1. **Nodes** – Devices that participate in the network (not mining).
2. **Miners** – Validate and add transactions/blocks.
3. **Large Miners** – Industrial-scale mining operations.
4. **Mining Pools** – Groups of miners combining resources.

---

## Core Takeaways

* **Bitcoin is a protocol** (rules of operation), not just a coin.
* Protocols each have one native coin; coins enable secure value transfer.
* Tokens are **built on protocols** via smart contracts (different layer).
* The banking sector is bypassed: users transact directly via technology.
* Bitcoin is chosen as the **primary case study** because it is:

  * The most famous, longest-running, and widely adopted cryptocurrency.

---

*** 35. Bitcoin's Monetary Policy ***

# Blockchain Course – Bitcoin’s Monetary Policy

---

## what is Monetary Policy?

Monetary policy is basically how a country manages its money supply and interest rates to keep the economy stable.

Governments (through central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve or the Bank of Japan) use monetary policy to:

* Control inflation (make sure prices don’t rise too fast).
* Encourage economic growth (by making borrowing easier or harder).
* Keep employment stable.

They do this mainly by:

1. **Changing interest rates** – lowering them to encourage borrowing and spending, or raising them to slow down inflation.
2. **Controlling money supply** – adding more money into the economy or restricting it.

In short: **Monetary policy is how central banks control money and credit to keep the economy healthy.**


## Introduction

* Just like central banks have **monetary policies**, Bitcoin has its own.
* Bitcoin’s monetary policy consists of two key components:

  1. **Halving**
  2. **Block Frequency**

---

## 1. The Halving Principle

### Definition

* The **block reward** (Bitcoins released per mined block) is halved every **210,000 blocks** (\~4 years).
* Fully pre-programmed in the **Bitcoin algorithm** (not decided by people).

### Historical Halvings

* 2009: 50 BTC per block.
* 2012: 25 BTC per block.
* 2016: 12.5 BTC per block.
* 2020: 6.25 BTC per block.
* 2024: 3.125 BTC per block.
* Continues halving until approximately **2140**.

### Supply Limit

* Because of Bitcoin’s divisibility limits, the **final reward** will be mined in **2140**.
* Total maximum supply: **21 million Bitcoins**.

### Effect on Supply & Inflation

* Block reward → decreases exponentially, approaching zero.
* Supply curve → asymptotic, converging to 21 million BTC.
* Inflation (new BTC released / existing BTC supply):

  * Decreases over time.
  * Leads to **deflationary nature** of Bitcoin (opposite of fiat currencies).

### Miner Incentives & Fees

* As block rewards decrease, **transaction fees** are expected to:

  * Increase with Bitcoin adoption.
  * Compensate miners for reduced rewards.
* Sustainability depends on **network demand** and **market adoption**.

---

## 2. Block Frequency

### Definition

* The time interval between the creation of two consecutive blocks.

### Examples by Cryptocurrency

* **Bitcoin** → \~10 minutes.
* **Ethereum** → \~15 seconds.
* **Ripple** → \~3.5 seconds.
* **Litecoin** → \~2.5 minutes.

### Mechanism

* Actual block times vary (statistical process).
* Controlled to average \~10 minutes via **difficulty adjustment** (explained later in course).

### What if there are no miners?

* **No new blocks will be created.** Since miners are the ones solving cryptographic puzzles to add blocks, the blockchain would simply stop.
* **No transactions get confirmed.** Users could still broadcast transactions, but they would remain pending in the mempool forever.
* **The system freezes.** Without miners, Bitcoin’s network cannot move forward, because mining is essential for both transaction validation and block creation.

### Why miners matter?

* Miners keep the blockchain secure by validating transactions.
* They add blocks, which also releases new bitcoins (block rewards + fees).
* If miners disappear, the incentive to secure the network is gone, and the blockchain halts.

---

### Case 1: No Miners

* **No new blocks are created** → the blockchain halts.
* **Transactions remain unconfirmed** in the mempool.
* **No security** → the network is unusable because no one is validating or adding blocks.

---

### Case 2: Very Few Miners

* **Blocks become very slow.** If only a few miners are left, finding the cryptographic puzzle takes much longer than 10 minutes.
* **Difficulty Adjustment:**

  * Bitcoin automatically adjusts mining difficulty every **2016 blocks (\~2 weeks)**.
  * If blocks are too slow, the difficulty lowers, making it easier for the small number of miners to find blocks.
  * Over time, this brings the block frequency back closer to the 10-minute target.
* **Security Risk:**

  * With very few miners, the network is easier to attack (e.g., 51% attack).
  * The system still works, but it’s less secure and more centralized.

---

In short:

* **No miners = system stops.**
* **Few miners = system slows but difficulty readjusts, eventually stabilizing, though with weaker security.**

### Live Example (Blockchain.com)

* Latest block times fluctuate (e.g., 3 min, 11 min, 17 min).
* Averaged over time → \~10 minutes.
* Useful resource: **blockchain.com / blockchain.info** for live data and statistics.

---

## Key Insights

* **Halving** controls Bitcoin’s supply and ensures scarcity.
* Total supply capped at **21 million BTC**.
* Bitcoin’s monetary system is **algorithm-driven** (not controlled by central authority).
* Bitcoin is **deflationary**, contrasting fiat currencies subject to inflation.
* Miner rewards shift gradually from block rewards → transaction fees.
* **Block frequency** ensures predictable block creation across time.

---

## Suggested Reading

* **Satoshi Nakamoto (2008)** – *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System* (bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).
* **Mark Jeftovic** – *This Time is Different Part 2: What Bitcoin Really Is*.

  * Discusses Bitcoin vs. fiat monetary policy.
  * Explores inflation, deflation, and central banking contrasts.

*** 36. Understanding Mining Difficulty ***

---

# Mining Difficulty

## 1. Introduction

* Mining difficulty was mentioned in Module 1 when discussing the mining target.
* This lecture provides a deeper understanding:

  1. What is the current target and how does it feel for a miner?
  2. How is mining difficulty calculated and adjusted?

---

## 2. Understanding the Current Target

### Leading Zeros and Pool Size

* Target is often represented by the number of leading zeros in the hash.
* Misleading diagram example:

  * 4 leading zeros looked like it reduced pool size to a quarter.
  * In reality, **one leading zero reduces the pool size by 16×** in hexadecimal.
  * 2 leading zeros reduce it by 16 × 16 = 1/256.
  * 3 leading zeros reduce it by 1/4096, and so on.

### Decimal Analogy

* With 5-digit numbers:

  * Full range: 0–99,999 → 100,000 options.
  * With 1 leading zero required: 0–9,999 → 10,000 options.
  * Reduced by 10×.
* In hexadecimal, each leading zero reduces by 16×.

### Current Example

* At recording: **18 leading zeros** required.
* Total possible hashes: 16^64 ≈ 10^77.
* With 18 zeros: 16^(64–18) ≈ 10^55 possible valid hashes.
* Probability: 10^55 / 10^77 = \~10^-22 (extremely small).
* Intuition: Less likely than winning most lotteries.
* Explains why mining requires massive computational power.

---

## 3. Mining Difficulty Definition

### Formula

* **Difficulty = Max Target ÷ Current Target**.

### Adjustment Period

* Adjusted every **2016 blocks** (≈ 2 weeks).
* Designed so each block takes \~10 minutes.
* If blocks are mined faster or slower, difficulty adjusts up or down.

### Max Target

* Defined at Bitcoin’s inception.
* Started with about **8 leading zeros**.
* Not the maximum possible hex number (all Fs).
* If it had started at the absolute maximum, mining would have been trivial and too many Bitcoins would have been mined before difficulty adjustment.

---

## 4. Intuitive Meaning of Difficulty

* Measures **how much harder it is to mine now compared to the beginning**.
* Example: Current difficulty ≈ 3 trillion.

  * Means it is \~3 trillion times harder to mine a Bitcoin than at the start.

---

## 5. Practical Observations

* Current target can be observed by looking at block hashes (leading zeros).
* Probability is consistent across nodes because difficulty adjustment is built into the Bitcoin protocol.
* Adjustment happens automatically without central authority.
* Each node independently recalculates based on the last 2016 blocks.

---

## 6. Difficulty Chart

* Chart appears stepped because adjustments occur every two weeks.
* At launch: difficulty = 1.
* As more miners joined and hash power increased, difficulty rose dramatically to maintain 10-minute block intervals.

---

## 7. Broader Perspective

* Centralized banking relies on complex macroeconomic tools like interest rates.
* Bitcoin’s decentralized system uses a **simple algorithm (adjusting required leading zeros)**.
* Despite global participation and powerful mining hardware (CPUs, GPUs, ASICs), the system remains stable.
* Demonstrates how a decentralized system can be as effective—or more efficient—than centralized monetary policy.

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

* Mining difficulty ensures blocks are consistently mined every 10 minutes.
* Probability of finding a valid nonce is extraordinarily small.
* Difficulty adjusts automatically every two weeks to balance network power.
* Difficulty today is trillions of times higher than at Bitcoin’s start.
* The system’s elegance lies in its simplicity and decentralization.

# Industrial-Scale Bitcoin Mining

## 1. Introduction

* This tutorial does not focus on technicalities or philosophies of Blockchain.
* Instead, it provides an overview of how **large-scale Bitcoin mining** operations work in practice.
* Reference: Quartz article *“Photos Inside One of the Largest Bitcoin Mines”* (@quartzqz.com).

---

## 2. Scale of Bitcoin Mining Operations

### Mining Facilities

* Massive hangars filled with rows of mining rigs.
* Each rig has an identifier and is networked with others.
* Designed to maximize hash power to solve cryptographic puzzles.

### Electricity Usage

* Immense electricity consumption to power the machines.
* Heat production is so high that:

  * Each rig has its own cooling mechanism.
  * Entire facilities are equipped with additional cooling systems.

### Equipment

* Mining rigs typically consist of **ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits)**, optimized for Bitcoin.
* Earlier systems used GPUs, but ASICs dominate industrial Bitcoin mining.
* Continuous maintenance is required (e.g., replacing or fixing units).

---

## 3. Human and Operational Aspects

* Facilities employ staff for maintenance and supervision.
* Workers sometimes even rest or nap inside the mining centers.
* Mining as a profession parallels traditional resource extraction, such as coal mining:

  * Both involve demanding work environments.
  * Bitcoin mining represents a modern, technology-driven form of mining.

---

## 4. Economic and Industrial Perspective

* Bitcoin mining has evolved into a **full-scale industrial sector**.
* Facilities resemble large factories, with infrastructure dedicated to solving cryptographic puzzles.
* Operations are not isolated—there are numerous large-scale mines worldwide.
* Represents a new kind of industry in the 21st century, built around proof-of-work.

---

## 5. Reflections

* The sole purpose of these massive operations is to solve Bitcoin’s cryptographic puzzle for proof-of-work validation.
* Demonstrates the transformative impact of Blockchain technology, creating entirely new economic activities.
* Mining centers showcase both technological progress and the scale of resources devoted to decentralized systems.
* Example given: a large Bitcoin mine in China.

---

## 6. Further Exploration

* Quartz article provides detailed photos and insights.
* Additional videos on YouTube allow viewers to:

  * Hear the constant noise of mining rigs and cooling systems.
  * See the scale of industrial Bitcoin mining in action.

---

## 7. Key Takeaways

* Industrial Bitcoin mines operate on a massive scale, both in size and energy consumption.
* Operations rely on specialized ASIC hardware and large infrastructures.
* Workers’ roles resemble traditional miners, though the “mineral” is digital.
* Bitcoin mining has developed into a significant economic sector of its own.
* Illustrates the real-world scale behind proof-of-work consensus.

---

*** 38. Mining Pools ***
# Mining Pools

## 1. Introduction

* Mining pools were introduced to address the imbalance between small individual miners and large industrial-scale mining operations.
* They allow smaller miners to collaborate and compete more fairly against large-scale facilities.

---

## 2. The Problem Without Pools

* In a pure competition model, industrial mines with massive hash power dominate.
* A small miner with a laptop or single rig has virtually no chance of finding the “golden nonce.”
* The system would be discouraging for individual participants.

---

## 3. What is a Mining Pool?

* A **mining pool** is a collaborative group of miners who combine their hash power.
* Operates similarly to a **lottery pool**: participants share resources and split rewards.
* Provides two main services:

  1. **Work distribution** – prevents miners from duplicating effort by assigning different nonce ranges.
  2. **Reward sharing** – distributes block rewards proportionally based on each miner’s contributed hash rate.

---

## 4. How It Works

* Example of nonce distribution:

  * Miner A checks nonce values 0–1 billion.
  * Miner B checks 1–2 billion.
  * Miner C checks 2–3 billion.
* When any miner in the pool finds the correct nonce, the pool receives the block reward and transaction fees.
* Rewards are split proportionally to hash rate contribution.

  * Example: A miner contributing 10% of total hash power receives 10% of the pool’s reward.

---

## 5. Accessibility and Ease of Use

* Mining pools make it simple for individuals to participate:

  * Purchase a mining rig (e.g., GPU-based for Ethereum, not Bitcoin).
  * Download pool software and connect the rig’s hash rate to the chosen pool.
* Removes technical complexity: miners may not even understand nonce searching or SHA-256, yet can still participate.

---

## 6. ASICs vs GPUs

* Early Bitcoin mining was GPU-based.
* Since 2014, **ASICs** dominate Bitcoin mining.
* GPUs are now obsolete for Bitcoin but still used for other cryptocurrencies (e.g., Ethereum, Zcash).
* Analogy: using a GPU for Bitcoin today is like bringing a wooden sword to a battle against a machine gun.

---

## 7. Examples of Major Pools

* **BTC.com** – one of the largest pools, historically holding \~26% of the network hash rate.
* **AntPool** – another major Chinese pool.
* **Slush Pool** – first ever mining pool, based in Czech Republic.
* Each pool provides software, websites, and services for miners.
* Pools charge a fee for participation.

---

## 8. Trade-offs in Pool Selection

* Larger pools have higher chances of finding blocks but yield smaller individual rewards due to many participants.
* Smaller pools offer less frequent wins but higher proportional payouts per block.
* Factors to consider:

  * Pool size and hash rate share.
  * Fees charged by the pool.
  * Reliability and transparency of the service.

---

## 9. Geographic Concentration

* At one point (2017), \~81% of Bitcoin hash power was based in China.
* Reason: **cheap electricity** due to subsidies and excess power redirected from plants.
* Iceland also hosts mining operations due to favorable electricity costs.
* Electricity cost is the single largest factor in mining profitability.
* Governments may impose restrictions, which can shift global mining distribution.

---

## 10. Energy Consumption Concerns

* Bitcoin mining consumes enormous amounts of electricity.
* At one time, annual Bitcoin mining consumption exceeded that of 159 individual countries.
* If treated as a country, Bitcoin mining would rank around **61st in the world** for electricity usage.
* Debate exists:

  * Critics highlight environmental impact.
  * Supporters argue relative comparisons show it is smaller than many traditional industries.
  * Example comparisons:

    * Bitcoin uses less energy than 17 NSA data centers combined.
    * Bitcoin uses only 20% of the output of a single Taiwanese coal plant.

---

## 11. Key Takeaways

* Mining pools make mining accessible and fairer by pooling resources.
* Rewards are distributed based on contribution, similar to a lottery pool.
* ASIC hardware is essential for Bitcoin mining today; GPUs are obsolete for Bitcoin but useful elsewhere.
* Geographic distribution depends on electricity costs, with China historically dominating.
* Bitcoin mining consumes significant energy, sparking debates on sustainability.

---


*** 39. Nonce Range ***
---

# Lecture Notes: Nonce Range in Blockchain

## 1. Recap: What is the Nonce?

* The **nonce** is a field in a block used in the cryptographic puzzle challenge.
* Miners can only vary the nonce (other fields remain fixed).
* Changing the nonce changes the hash.
* Goal: Find a hash below a certain target → miner wins the puzzle, adds block, and earns reward.

---

## 2. Limitations of the Nonce

* The nonce is **not infinite**.
* It is a **32-bit unsigned integer**.

  * Range: 0 to 2³² – 1
  * Approx. **4 billion possible values**.
* Unsigned integer: No negative values, hence capacity is \~4 billion.

---

## 3. Probability of Finding a Valid Hash

* Total possible hashes: 16⁶⁴ ≈ 10⁷⁷.
* Valid hashes (with 18 leading zeros): 16^(64–18) ≈ 2 × 10⁵⁵.
* Probability a random hash is valid:
  **2 × 10⁻²²**.
* Even testing all 4 billion nonces gives probability:
  ≈ **10⁻¹² (0.000000000001%)**.
* **Conclusion:** One nonce range alone is not enough to guarantee finding a solution.

---

## 4. Speed of Nonce Exhaustion

* A modest miner: **100 million hashes/second**.
* Exhausting full nonce range (4 billion):
  4,000,000,000 ÷ 100,000,000 = **40 seconds**.
* After 40 seconds, nonce space is depleted.

---

## 5. Solution: Timestamp Field

* Each block contains a **timestamp** (Unix time).
* Unix time = seconds elapsed since Jan 1, 1970.
* Updates every second → **block data changes automatically**.
* Even a one-second increment alters the block → avalanche effect causes completely new hash values.
* **Result:** Nonce range can be reused every second.
  Timestamp + nonce = effectively infinite possibilities.

---

## 6. One Miner vs. Mining Pools

* **One miner (100 million hashes/sec):**

  * Takes \~40 seconds to cover full nonce range.
  * Timestamp updates every second → miner can continuously recycle nonce attempts.
* **Mining pools (e.g., SlushPool, ViaBTC):**

  * Enormous hash power.
  * Example: Current Bitcoin network hash rate ≈ **22 million trillion hashes/sec**.
  * Pools cover nonce range in fractions of a second.
  * Waiting for timestamp updates = wasted capacity.

---

## 7. Key Takeaways

* The nonce has a hard cap: \~4 billion values.
* Probability of solving puzzle with one nonce cycle is **extremely small**.
* Timestamp field extends possibilities by allowing nonce reuse every second.
* For individual miners, this resolves the limitation.
* For mining pools with massive computational power, timestamp alone is insufficient.
* **Next step:** How mining pools architecturally solve this constraint (covered in the following lecture).

---

*** 40. How Miners Pick Transactions (Part 1) ***
---

# Lecture Notes: How Miners Pick Transactions

## 1. Transaction Source

* Transactions come from the **mempool** (memory pool).
* Each node/miner has its own mempool containing **unconfirmed transactions**.
* Transactions happen continuously, but blocks are only created about every **10 minutes**.
* The mempool acts as a **staging area** until inclusion in a block.

---

## 2. Block Transaction Limit

* In reality: block size limit is **1 MB**, fitting \~2,000 transactions.
* Simplified example: assume a miner can include **5 transactions**.

---

## 3. Miner’s Selection Criteria

* Each transaction specifies a **fee** (set by the sender, not compulsory).
* Miners earn these fees **in addition to block rewards**.
* Miners therefore prioritize **transactions with the highest fees**.
* Example: miner selects top 5 highest-fee transactions for inclusion.

---

## 4. Connection to the Nonce Problem

* Reminder: nonce range is **0 to 4 billion** (32-bit unsigned integer).
* Timestamp updates every **1 second**, allowing nonce values to be reused.
* For a **single miner**, this setup works because they cannot exhaust the full nonce range within one second.
* For **large miners or mining pools**, nonce ranges can be exhausted almost instantly.

**Issue:** What happens when miners or pools finish the nonce range before the timestamp updates?

---

## 5. Solution: Block Reconfiguration

* When the nonce range is exhausted too quickly, miners **reconfigure the block**.
* Reconfiguration involves **swapping out transactions**:

  * Remove the transaction with the **lowest fee**.
  * Replace it with the **next highest fee** from the mempool.
  * This changes the block data, resulting in a **different hash output** for the same nonce values.
* Process repeats until timestamp updates, at which point nonce range resets.

---

## 6. Mining Pools and Automation

* All of this process happens **algorithmically**:

  * Miners don’t manually select transactions.
  * Mining pools provide the algorithms to handle:

    * **Transaction selection**
    * **Nonce allocation**
    * **Avoiding duplicate work** among miners in the pool
* Pools manage **thousands of miners** and coordinate work efficiently.

---

## 7. Effect of Transaction Fees

* Transactions with **very low or zero fees** are likely to remain stuck in the mempool.
* Pools often ignore transactions below a **threshold fee level**.
* If not picked up, the transaction is typically returned to the sender (standard: \~72 hours).
* Wallets usually suggest a **recommended fee** to ensure timely inclusion.

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

1. **Transactions come from the mempool.**
2. **Miners prioritize highest-fee transactions.**
3. **Nonce range alone is insufficient** for large-scale miners.
4. **Block reconfiguration** provides additional variability.
5. **Pools automate the process**, removing complexity for individual miners.
6. **Low fees risk exclusion**, leading to stuck or returned transactions.

1. Collect transactions                 1. Collect transactions
   from mempool.                           from mempool (shared across pool).

2. Sort by fee (highest first).          2. Pool algorithm sorts by fee
                                            and sets fee threshold.

3. Build block (limited size).           3. Build candidate block template.

4. Start hashing with nonce range.       4. Divide nonce range among miners
                                            to avoid duplication.

5. If nonce range exhausted:             5. If a miner exhausts its nonce range:
   - Wait for timestamp update              - Request new block template
     (every 1s), or                          from pool.
   - Reconfigure block: replace             - Pool reconfigures by swapping
     lowest-fee transaction with               transactions (low → high fee).
     next highest-fee one.

6. Continue until valid hash found.      6. Pool miners keep working with
                                            refreshed blocks + new nonce ranges.

7. Broadcast block once solved.          7. Winning miner’s result is submitted
                                            to pool → pool broadcasts block.
-------------------code----------------------

*** 41. How Miners Pick Transactions (Part 2) ***

# Lecture Notes: Blockchain Charts, Transactions, and Fees

## 1. Transactions per Block

* Average: \~2000 transactions per block (over the past year).
* Recently dropped to \~1,300.
* Variability depends on **size of individual transactions** (measured in KB/MB).
* Larger transactions reduce the total number that can fit into a block.

## 2. Average Block Size

* Maximum block size: **1 MB**.
* Actual average: \~1.0–1.05 MB.
* Miners typically **maximize usage** of block space to earn as many fees as possible.
* Blocks are rarely left half empty.

---

## 3. Transaction Fees

* Fees are **separate from block rewards** (newly minted Bitcoin).
* Fees vary based on:

  1. **Demand**:

     * High demand → higher competition for inclusion → fees rise.
     * Low demand → fewer urgent transactions → fees fall.
  2. **Exchange Rate (USD vs. BTC)**:

     * Fees shown in USD fluctuate with Bitcoin’s price.
     * In BTC terms, the trend is more stable.

**Example:**

* December 2017: miners earned **\$22M in one day** from fees.
* Recently: about **\$400k in one day**.

---

## 4. Transaction Rate and Mempool

* Charts also show how many transactions are added to the **mempool per second**.
* Pattern depends on **time of day** and global activity.
* Example: noticeable drops around 4 PM (Australia time zone observation).

---

## 5. Transaction Accelerators

* Offered by **mining pools**.
* Purpose: help stuck transactions with low fees get confirmed.
* Users submit their **transaction hash** and pay extra.
* Pools then prioritize that transaction.
* Example of probability:

  * 75% chance confirmation within 1 hour.
  * 98% chance within 4 hours.

## 6. Additional Reading

* Article: **“How Bitcoin Mining Works”** (CoinDesk).
* Covers nodes, puzzles, difficulty, and mining economics.
* By this stage, students should understand all the concepts discussed.

---

## 7. Key Takeaways

1. **Transactions per block** vary depending on transaction size.
2. **Block size** remains near 1 MB, as miners maximize space for fees.
3. **Fees** are driven by demand and exchange rate fluctuations.
4. **Mempool** charts show the flow of unconfirmed transactions over time.
5. **Transaction accelerators** exist as a paid option to speed up confirmations.
6. Supplementary reading reinforces mining concepts and block configuration.

*** 42. CPU's vs GPU's vs ASIC's ***
# Blockchain Lecture Notes

## Mining Hardware: CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs

### 1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)

* General-purpose processor, handles all operations in a computer.
* **Versatile** but **not specialized**.
* Can solve SHA-256 hashes but at a limited speed.
* **Performance**: \~10 MH/s (10 million hashes per second).
* Insufficient compared to Bitcoin’s network hash rate (≈22 million trillion H/s).

---

### 2. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)

* Specialized for **matrix operations** used in graphics rendering.
* Less versatile than CPUs but **more efficient at parallel computations**.
* Better suited for hashing than CPUs.
* **Performance**: \~1 GH/s (1 billion hashes per second).
* Once used for Bitcoin mining, now mainly used for Ethereum and other coins.
* **Limitation**: Outclassed by ASICs in Bitcoin mining.

---

### 3. ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)

* Purpose-built hardware for a **single task**: SHA-256 hash calculation.
* Operates at the circuit level (physical computation, not logical instructions).
* Extremely efficient and powerful.
* **Performance**: >1,000 GH/s (1 TH/s) and beyond.
* Example: Antminer S9 (\~13.5 TH/s).
* **Limitations**:

  * Only useful for specific algorithms (e.g., SHA-256 for Bitcoin).
  * Cannot mine Ethereum (ETH uses Ethash, a **memory-heavy** algorithm designed to resist ASICs).
  * Require high power and cooling.

---

### 4. Cloud Mining

* Renting remote mining hardware hosted elsewhere.
* Users pay fees to access hash power.
* Comparable to cloud computing/storage but applied to mining.
* Risks: Often associated with marketing gimmicks or misleading claims.

---

### 5. Example: GPU vs ASIC Mining Rigs

* GPU rigs (e.g., 6 GPUs) → \~180 MH/s for Ethereum.
* ASICs (USB sticks or industrial units) → hundreds of MH/s to tens of TH/s.
* **Key takeaway**:

  * ASICs dominate Bitcoin.
  * GPUs still relevant for Ethereum and some altcoins.
  * Marketing often misrepresents GPU rigs as “Bitcoin miners.”

---

### 6. Important Considerations

* **Hash rate comparisons** are only meaningful within the same cryptocurrency.

  * Different algorithms vary in difficulty (e.g., SHA-256 vs Ethash).
* For Ethereum:

  * ETH hash rate limited by memory access (memory hardness).
  * GPUs remain viable because ASICs cannot outperform memory speed.
* Bitcoin:

  * ASICs are the standard.
  * CPUs/GPUs are obsolete.

---

### 7. Key Takeaways

* **Progression of specialization**: CPU → GPU → ASIC.
* Increased specialization leads to massive performance gains but reduced flexibility.
* Ethereum designed Ethash to resist ASIC dominance.
* Hardware directly influences which cryptocurrencies are profitable to mine.
* Understanding hardware gives insight into cryptocurrency architecture and design choices.
