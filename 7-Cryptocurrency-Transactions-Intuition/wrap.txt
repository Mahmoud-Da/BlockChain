# Blockchain Course – Transactions Module

### Introduction

* This module shifts focus from **mining** to **transactions**.
* Blockchain transactions differ significantly from traditional **banking systems**.
* Goal: Understand how transactions, wallets, and privacy work in blockchain.

---

### Key Topics in This Module

1. **Transactions and UTXOs**

   * UTXO = *Unspent Transaction Output*.
   * Core difference between blockchain transactions and banking.
   * First tutorial may feel challenging—concepts are very different.
   * Knowledge is reinforced in the first three tutorials.

2. **Transaction Fees**

   * Where fees come from and how they are applied in blockchain systems.

3. **Wallets**

   * How cryptocurrency wallets work.
   * Practical setup and operation.

4. **Keys and Signatures**

   * Public and private keys.
   * Digital signatures and privacy in blockchain transactions.
   * Includes demo with a tool to visualize key generation and usage.

5. **SegWit (Segregated Witness)**

   * What it is and why it was introduced.
   * Benefits for Bitcoin and other networks.

6. **Public Key vs. Bitcoin Address**

   * Commonly confused concepts clarified.

7. **Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets**

   * How HD wallets function.
   * Their role in securely managing multiple addresses.

---

### Notes on Scope

* Primary focus will be on **Bitcoin** as a working cryptocurrency.
* Concepts largely apply to other cryptocurrencies (e.g., Litecoin).
* Once the Bitcoin foundation is clear, adapting to other cryptos is easier.

---

### Guidance

* The first tutorial may feel unfamiliar, but the **second and third tutorials reinforce key concepts**.
* By the end of the first three tutorials, learners should understand blockchain transactions well.

---

### Closing

* This module lays the foundation for deeper exploration into blockchain.
* Next step: Begin with transactions and UTXOs.

# Blockchain Course – Transactions and UTXOs

### Introduction

* Topic: **Transactions and UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs)** in blockchain.
* Key difference: Blockchain transactions behave differently than **banking transactions**.
* In blockchain, transactions continue to exist as UTXOs until they are used in a new transaction.

---

### What is a UTXO?

* **UTXO = Unspent Transaction Output.**
* Every time you receive Bitcoin (or similar cryptocurrency), you receive it as a UTXO.
* A UTXO remains valid until it is spent in a new transaction.
* Unlike banks, blockchain has **no accounts** and **no balances**.

  * Everything is represented as **transactions recorded on the blockchain**.

---

### Example 1: Receiving Transactions

* Received:

  * Mark → 0.1 BTC
  * Hadelin → 0.3 BTC
  * Helen → 0.6 BTC
  * Susan → 0.7 BTC
* These are all **UTXOs** associated with the recipient.

---

### Example 2: Buying a Bicycle (0.5 BTC)

* Need: 0.5 BTC.
* Choose the 0.6 BTC UTXO from Helen.
* Rule: **Inputs must be fully used**.

  * Cannot partially spend a UTXO.
  * Must use the entire 0.6 BTC.
* Output structure:

  * 0.5 BTC → Bike shop
  * 0.1 BTC → Back to self (change)
* Result:

  * Helen’s 0.6 BTC UTXO is consumed.
  * Two new UTXOs are created:

    * Bike shop: 0.5 BTC
    * Self: 0.1 BTC

---

### Example 3: Buying a Second Bicycle (1.1 BTC)

* Cost: 1.1 BTC.
* Available UTXOs:

  * Hadelin → 0.3 BTC
  * Susan → 0.7 BTC
  * Self → 0.1 BTC
* Combine these three UTXOs to reach 1.1 BTC.
* Output:

  * 1.1 BTC → Bike shop
* Result:

  * All three UTXOs consumed.
  * New UTXO created for bike shop: 1.1 BTC.
  * No change returned to self.

---

### Important Observations

* **Transactions feed into each other.**

  * One transaction consumes previous UTXOs and creates new ones.
  * The blockchain is a continuous chain of transaction outputs and inputs.
* **Balance = sum of UTXOs.**

  * While we think in terms of account balances, in blockchain your "balance" is really the sum of all UTXOs associated with you.

---

### Practice Recommendation

* To better understand:

  1. Imagine receiving different amounts as transactions.
  2. Try constructing transactions for purchases.
  3. Calculate inputs, outputs, and any change sent back to yourself.
* Repetition helps clarify the logic of UTXOs.

---

### Closing

* UTXOs are central to how blockchain transactions operate.
* The system may feel confusing at first, but with practice the logic becomes clear.
* Next tutorials will provide more examples and reinforce the concept.
