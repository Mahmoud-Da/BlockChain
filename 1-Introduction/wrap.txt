## Learning Paths

### 1. Full Monty (Comprehensive Path)

* Complete **all modules** (intuition + practical)
* Covers every aspect: theory + coding
* Most thorough but time-intensive

### 2. Expert Blockchain Knowledge Path

* Focus only on **intuition tutorials** (Modules 1, 2, and 3 intuition)
* No coding required
* Suitable for:

  * Consulting in blockchain
  * Strategy/business applications
  * Gaining deep conceptual understanding

### 3. Blockchain Fundamentals Path

* Complete **only Module 1 (Blockchain Intuition)**
* Provides a strong foundation in blockchain basics
* Enables meaningful conversations about blockchain
* Covers key concepts like:

  * Decentralization
  * Hash cryptography
  * Byzantine fault tolerance

---

## Flexibility in Learning

* Tutorials can be taken in **any order**
* You may:

  * Start from Module 3 if you already have grounding
  * Skip coding sections and return later if desired

---

## Key Takeaways

* Course is structured for both **developers** and **non-developers**
* Multiple learning paths allow tailoring based on goals and time
* Even completing **only Module 1 Intuition** gives strong blockchain literacy
* The course balances **intuition (concepts)** and **practical (coding)**
