*** 16. Step 1 ***
# Practical Activities Course: Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Smart Contracts

## Instructors

* Adla (second instructor for the course)

## Course Overview

This course contains **three main modules**:

1. **Module 1: Blockchain**

   * Create a general blockchain.
   * Each block can store arbitrary data.

2. **Module 2: Cryptocurrency**

   * Start from the blockchain created in Module 1.
   * Decentralize it across multiple computers/servers.
   * Create a cryptocurrency called **AT Coin**.

3. **Module 3: Smart Contracts**

   * Create a smart contract for a simulated ICO of 1 million AT Coins.

## Required Tools

* **Anaconda IDE** (recommended for Python 3.6 development)

  * Includes Spyder IDE and Jupyter Notebook.
  * Useful for practical tutorials.
* **Python 3.6** (not Python 2.7, due to syntax compatibility)
* **Packages**:

  * `flask` (for creating web-based blockchain API)
  * `requests` (for sending requests such as mining blocks or adding transactions)
* **Postman**

  * User-friendly HTTP client for interacting with the blockchain.
  * Alternative: cURL (less user-friendly for beginners)

## Step 1: Installing Anaconda

1. Go to the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/) and download the installer.
2. Select the installer for your operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac).
3. Choose **Python 3.6** version.
4. Run the installer:

   * Click through `Continue → Continue → Agree → Install`.
   * Wait for installation to complete.

## Step 2: Launching Anaconda

* **Windows/Linux:** Find Anaconda Navigator in the program list.
* **Mac:** Find Anaconda Navigator in Applications.
* Launch it and wait for initialization.

### Inside Anaconda

* Work in the **root environment** (no need for a virtual environment for this course).
* Recommended IDE for practical use: **Spyder**

  * Jupyter Notebook is better for combining code with LaTeX/mathematical notation.
* Launch Spyder through Anaconda Navigator.

## Step 3: Preparing Your Project

1. Create a main folder, e.g., `blockchain_a-z`, with three subfolders:

   * `Module 1` → Blockchain
   * `Module 2` → Cryptocurrency
   * `Module 3` → Smart Contracts
2. Create a new Python file:

   * `File → New File`
   * Save as `blockchain.py` inside `Module 1` folder.
3. Close default `10.py` file in Spyder (not needed).
4. This `blockchain.py` will contain the implementation of the **general blockchain**.

## Step 4: Next Steps

1. Install the necessary Python packages:

   * `flask`
   * `requests`
2. Set up **Postman** to interact with your blockchain API.
3. Begin implementing the general blockchain in `blockchain.py`:

   * Create plain blocks
   * Enable adding arbitrary data to blocks

**Next Tutorial:** Installing packages and preparing Postman for blockchain interaction.
