*** 6. What is a Blockchain ***
# Blockchain Course – Lecture Notes (What is a Blockchain? High-Level Overview)

## Origins of Blockchain

* **Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta (1991)**

  * Published a paper: *"How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document"*.
  * Contained most of the core ideas behind what is now called blockchain.
* **Satoshi Nakamoto**

  * Later formalized the concept and introduced the term "blockchain."

## Definition

* **Wikipedia definition:**
  “A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.”
* This definition is general but provides a starting point.

## Structure of a Block

* **Components of a block:**

  1. **Data** – Information stored (e.g., “Hello world”).
  2. **Previous Hash** – Reference to the hash of the block before it.
  3. **Own Hash** – Unique digital fingerprint of the block.

* **Hash (digital fingerprint):**

  * Derived from the block’s data and previous hash.
  * Always 64 characters long.
  * Provides a unique, tamper-detectable identity for the block.

## The Genesis Block

* The **first block** in a blockchain.
* Called the **Genesis Block**.
* Characteristics:

  * Always remains block number one (cannot be replaced).
  * Contains data but **no previous hash** (represented as all zeros).
  * Has its own hash.

## Linking Blocks Together

* Each block references the **previous block’s hash**.
* This creates a **cryptographic chain** of blocks.
* Example:

  * Block 2’s `previous hash` = Block 1’s `hash`.
  * Block 3’s `previous hash` = Block 2’s `hash`.

Blockchain Structure (High-Level View)
-------------------code----------------------

[ Block 1 (Genesis) ]        [ Block 2 ]                 [ Block 3 ]
Data: Hello World            Data: Some Data             Data: More Data
Prev Hash: 0000...           Prev Hash: hash1            Prev Hash: hash2
Hash: hash1                  Hash: hash2                 Hash: hash3

      |--------------------->|--------------------------->|
             linked                  linked

-------------------code----------------------
Explanation:
- Each block stores Data, Prev Hash, and Hash.
- "Prev Hash" always equals the Hash of the previous block.
- The Genesis Block has no previous hash (set to 0000...).
- Changing any block changes its hash and breaks the chain.


## Importance of Cryptographic Linking

* If data in a block is tampered with:

  * Its hash (fingerprint) changes.
  * The next block’s `previous hash` no longer matches.
  * This breaks the chain and signals tampering.
* Therefore, blockchain ensures **integrity and immutability**.

## Key Takeaway

* A blockchain is essentially a **chain of blocks linked by hashes**.
* Tampering with any block invalidates the chain.
* This cryptographic linking provides **security and trust** in the system.

## What’s Next

* Future tutorials will cover:

  * Hash cryptography (next lesson).
  * Mining.
  * Distributed peer-to-peer networks.
  * Consensus protocols.
  * Immutable ledgers.

# Lecture Notes: Cryptography and SHA256 in Blockchain

## Introduction

* Topic: **Cryptography in Blockchain**
* Focus: The role of the **SHA256 Hash algorithm**.
* SHA256 = one of the **core building blocks** of blockchain technology.

---

## Fingerprint Analogy

* Every person has a **unique fingerprint** (low probability of duplicates: \~1 in 60 million).
* Fingerprints are identifiers, widely used in forensics to identify individuals.
* Idea: apply the same concept to **digital documents**.
* Digital fingerprint = **SHA256 Hash**.

---

## What is SHA256?

* **SHA** = Secure Hash Algorithm.
* **256** = number of bits (output size).
* Always produces a **64-character hexadecimal hash**.

  * Hexadecimal = digits (0–9) + letters (A–F).
  * Each character = 4 bits → 64 × 4 = 256 bits.
* Created by the **NSA**, but the algorithm is **public and open**.
* Widely used in:

  * Password storage
  * Document verification
  * Blockchain

---

## Properties of SHA256

1. **One-way function**

   * Cannot reverse-engineer the original data from the hash.
   * Similar to fingerprints: cannot recreate a person from a fingerprint.

2. **Deterministic**

   * Same input → always same output.
   * Example: entering identical data always returns the same hash.

3. **Fast computation**

   * Hash must be computed quickly for efficiency in blockchain processes.

4. **Avalanche Effect**

   * Small changes in input = **completely different hash**.
   * Example: changing a single character drastically changes the output.
   * Crucial for blockchain integrity.

5. **Collision Resistance**

   * A “collision” = two different inputs producing the same hash.
   * In theory possible (pigeonhole principle), but extremely rare.
   * Must withstand **artificially created collisions** (important for security).
   * Prevents document forgery (e.g., property ownership fraud).

---

## Demonstration (Tools Provided)

* Toolkit: [tools.superdatascience.com/blockchain/hash](https://tools.superdatascience.com/blockchain/hash)
* Created by Anders Brownworth (Anders94).
* Features:

  * Input any data → see resulting SHA256 hash.
  * Shows determinism and avalanche effect.
  * Works on **any digital input** (text, images, videos, executables, etc.).

---

## Additional Notes on Collisions

* **Pigeonhole Principle**: finite number of hashes vs. infinite possible inputs → collisions inevitable in theory.
* Acceptable when rare, but **deliberately engineered collisions** are a risk.
* A secure hash algorithm must **resist intentional collision attacks**.

---

## Summary of SHA256 Requirements

For a hash algorithm to be useful in blockchain, it must be:

1. One-way
2. Deterministic
3. Fast to compute
4. Demonstrate avalanche effect
5. Collision-resistant

---

## Recommended Reading

* **“On the Secure Hash Algorithm Family”**

  * Chapter 1 of *Cryptography in Context*
  * Authors: Penard & Werkhoven
  * Explains SHA256 in detail

---

## Conclusion

* SHA256 is the **digital fingerprint system** powering blockchain.
* Its properties ensure **security, integrity, and reliability**.
* Mastering SHA256 is crucial for understanding blockchain concepts such as mining and consensus protocols.
