*** 5. Plan of Attack  ***
# Blockchain Course â€“ Lecture Notes (Introduction & Plan of Attack)

## Purpose of the Section

* To provide a **structured plan** for learning blockchain.
* Blockchain itself is **not inherently complex**, but it contains many interrelated components of varying complexity.
* Understanding requires placing components in the **right order** for faster mastery.

## Learning Roadmap (Plan of Attack)

1. **High-Level Overview of Blockchain**

   * Establish basic fundamentals.
   * Serves as the foundation for all later topics.

2. **Cryptography & SHA-256 Hash Algorithm**

   * Role of cryptography in blockchains.
   * Explanation of SHA-256 (no deep mathematics required).
   * Understanding how blocks are cryptographically linked.
   * Additional reading available for deeper insights.

3. **Immutable Ledger**

   * Compare blockchain with traditional ledgers.
   * Understand the **first layer of security** blockchain provides in record keeping.

4. **Distributed Peer-to-Peer Networks**

   * How distribution of the ledger enhances security.
   * Introduces a **second layer of security** through decentralization.

5. **Mining (Two-Part Tutorial)**

   * **Part 1:** Mechanics of mining, nonce parameter.
   * **Part 2:** The cryptographic puzzle.
   * Learn why miners need large computational power and specialized rigs.

6. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**

   * The problem of the Byzantine Generals.
   * Applications: blockchain, airplanes, nuclear facilities, International Space Station.
   * Importance in distributed systems.

7. **Consensus Protocol (Two-Part Tutorial)**

   * **Part 1:** How consensus protects against attackers.
   * **Part 2:** How consensus resolves competing chains and ensures blockchain evolution despite global distribution and network lag.

8. **Blockchain Demo (Final Tutorial)**

   * Visual demonstration combining all concepts.
   * Summary of the entire section in one integrated example.

## Structure & Expectations

* Total: **10 tutorials** (not including this introductory lecture).
* Each tutorial builds on the previous one.
* Emphasis on **visual demonstrations** for clarity.
* Requires patience, but designed to be engaging and fun.

## Outcomes

* Gain **solid understanding** of blockchain fundamentals.
* Ability to **discuss blockchain confidently** with others (knowledge above \~90% of the population).
* Preparation for practical tutorials where you will build your first blockchain step by step.
